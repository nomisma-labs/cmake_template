# Build

## Commands

Run `./bootstrap.sh` for dependency initialization, fresh builds/tests and quality checks.
Bootstrap discovers enabled configure/build/test presets with matching names through CMake,
including included files and `CMakeUserPresets.json`; it uses the repo's `build/<preset>/` layout.
The default run selects every discovered preset except `release`. Use `./bootstrap.sh <preset>`
to select one explicitly; `--help` lists the discovered names. For a personal preset, supply
matching build and test entries that reference its configure preset. CMake checks the compiler
and generator from the preset rather than bootstrap guessing them from its name.
Each run deletes only the selected build directories and previous `build/bootstrap/` logs.
Python compatibility/imports, headers and formatting are always checked; naming runs when `clang` is selected and is
reported as skipped otherwise. A failed check returns a nonzero exit code. Invalid arguments
are rejected before cleanup. For everyday incremental work, use the commands below.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive   # once, after cloning
cmake --preset dev                        # once: configure into build/dev
cd build/dev
ninja                                     # build; reruns cmake itself when a CMakeLists.txt changes
ctest --output-on-failure                 # test; -R <regex> picks tests by name
bin/<app>                                 # run an app
```

Other presets work the same way in `build/<preset>`. `cmake --workflow --preset <preset>`
configures, builds and tests in one command; CI uses it.

## Toolchain

| Tool | Version | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| GCC | 15.2 (`g++-15`) | the main compiler |
| Clang tools | 19 (`clang++-19`, `clangd-19`, `clang-tidy-19`, `clang-scan-deps-19`, `clang-format-19`) | second compiler, sanitizers, IDE, checks |
| CMake | 3.30 or newer (4.4 in use) | build |
| Ninja | 1.11 or newer | generator (Makefiles can't build modules) |
| Python | 3.10 or newer (3.12 in use) | tools and Python integration checks; standard library only |
| Catch2 | 3 (system package, or a pinned download) | tests |

Only the versioned Clang names exist on Ubuntu (`clang++-19`, not `clang++`), so presets and
scripts name them explicitly. The CI image installs the same set.

## Python environment

Repository scripts currently need no third-party Python packages or virtual environment.
Python 3.10 is the minimum because the scripts use annotations such as `str | None`;
Python 3.12 is used in the development and CI environments.

`python3 tools/check_python.py` checks the interpreter version, compiles repository Python
scripts in memory, and checks their imported modules. It discovers tracked and unignored new
scripts through Git; local helpers are syntax-checked without executing them. Bootstrap runs
this check before builds and skips Python-dependent steps if it fails. When `clang` is selected,
it also checks that the clang-tidy runner starts. The runner's optional PyYAML support is not
needed by our current naming check.

## Presets

`CMakePresets.json` holds the build settings that developers, CI, IDEs and agents share.

| Preset | Compiler and build type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | GCC 15, Debug | daily work |
| `complete` | GCC 15, Debug | every app, including experiments, regardless of its `BUILD_FOR` list |
| `release` | GCC 15, Release | benchmarks and production builds |
| `clang` | Clang 19, Debug | second compiler; its database feeds clangd and clang-tidy |
| `asan` | Clang 19, Debug, AddressSanitizer + UBSan | memory and undefined-behaviour checks (GCC 15.2 crashes on UBSan with modules) |
| `ci` | GCC 15, RelWithDebInfo, warnings as errors | CI |

Personal presets go in `CMakeUserPresets.json`, which is git-ignored. For example, to build
against a local checkout of the config repo (see Dependencies):

```json
{
  "version": 6,
  "configurePresets": [
    { "name": "dev-local", "inherits": "dev",
      "cacheVariables": { "FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_CONFIG": "${sourceDir}/../config" } }
  ]
}
```

## Selecting apps by preset

`nom_app()` accepts an optional list: `BUILD_FOR dev ci`. Omit it, or use `BUILD_FOR any`, to
include the app in every preset. Use `BUILD_FOR complete` for an experiment that should only join
complete builds. The `complete` preset inherits the `dev` compiler settings and selects every app,
including apps listed only for other presets.

Apps outside the selected list remain available by target name, but are excluded from the
normal build and installation. The same selection applies to installation of their config
folders; a folder shared by multiple apps is installed if any of those apps is selected.
Dependencies of a requested target are still built as needed.

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset dev                         # configure, build selected targets, run tests
cmake --workflow --preset complete                         # same workflow with every app
cmake --build --preset dev --target example_sandbox_native_module  # one excluded app explicitly
```

`any` means every preset; `complete` names the preset that builds every app. For example,
`BUILD_FOR dev` includes the app in both `dev` and `complete`, so adding `complete` to that list
is optional. A normal build includes the selected apps and test executables; the workflow
also runs the tests.

Presets set the shared cache variable `NOM_BUILD_PRESET`. A custom preset inherits its parent's
selection unless it overrides that variable, so `dev-local` above still selects `dev` apps.
Without a preset it defaults to `dev`; set `-DNOM_BUILD_PRESET=release` or `complete` when needed.
This selects apps independently of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`; project options such as `BUILD_APPS`
and `BUILD_MODULES` still apply. For every app with Clang, use
`cmake --preset clang -DNOM_BUILD_PRESET=complete`, then build that preset.

## compile_commands.json

Every preset writes this compilation database (the exact compiler command for each file) into
its build directory. Clang tools can't read GCC's module flags, so clangd and clang-tidy use the
`clang` preset's database: `.clangd` points at `build/clang`, so configure and build that preset
once. In VS Code, use the clangd extension with `"clangd.path": "/usr/bin/clangd-19"` and
`"clangd.arguments": ["--experimental-modules-support"]`.

## The CMake kit

`cmake/kit/` is shared by every repo and owned by the template (change it in `cmake_template`, then
run `tools/sync_template.py` in the other repos). The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` includes
`cmake/kit/nom_kit.cmake`, which sets C++23 without compiler extensions and defines:

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nom_project_options()` | The project's options (below). Call it right after `project()`. |
| `nom_lib(<name> [SOURCES …] [HEADERS …] [MODULES …] [BASE_DIR <dir>] [PUBLIC_DEPS …] [PRIVATE_DEPS …])` | Library `<name>` plus alias `nom::<name>`. Headers and modules become file sets rooted at `BASE_DIR` (default `core/`). Without sources or modules it is header-only (INTERFACE). |
| `nom_app(<name> SOURCES … [DEPS …] [BUILD_FOR …])` | Executable target `<project>_<name>`, binary `bin/<name>`; selects default build/install participation by preset; collects an adjacent `config/` directory. |
| `nom_c2test(<suite> SOURCES … [DEPS …])` | Catch2 executable `<project>_<suite>`, registered with CTest. Needs `nom_find_catch2()`. |
| `nom_library_usage_tests(<dir> [OPTIONS …])` | Integration tests: build and run a separate project using this library as an installed package and from source (see Tests). |
| `nom_install_package(TARGETS … [DEPENDENCIES …])` | Install rules and `<project>-config.cmake`, so consumers can `find_package(<project>)` and link `nom::<target>`. |
| `nom_require_submodule(<path>)` | Fails early, with the fix, when a submodule wasn't checked out. |
| `nom_find_catch2()` | The system Catch2 3, otherwise a pinned download; called at the project root when tests are enabled, before code directories. |

`nom_c2test` is specific to Catch2. Future test frameworks can have their own helpers
without changing `nom_lib` or `nom_app`.

The options, where `<PROJECT>` is the upper-case project name. Set them with `-D` on the command
line; the CMake files read the variables:

| Option | Variable | Default | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<PROJECT>_BUILD_TESTS` | `nom_build_tests` | ON when top level | `tests/` |
| `<PROJECT>_BUILD_APPS` | `nom_build_apps` | ON when top level | `apps/`, including the sandbox |
| `<PROJECT>_BUILD_MODULES` | `nom_build_modules` | ON | the C++ modules and the code that imports them |
| `<PROJECT>_INSTALL` | `nom_install` | ON | install rules and the package config |

In a superbuild each repo brings its own copy of the kit; the first one loaded wins, and a
different version is reported as a warning.

## Dependencies

- **Our repos:** a git submodule in `external/<name>`, wired with
  `FetchContent_Declare(<name> SOURCE_DIR ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/external/<name>)` and
  `FetchContent_MakeAvailable(<name>)`. FetchContent keeps the first declaration of a name, so in a
  superbuild the outermost project must declare all shared pins before making any dependency
  available. Use consistent dependency names; version compatibility remains the system repo's
  responsibility. See the [FetchContent documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html).
- **Third-party code:** a submodule pinned to a release tag, handled case by case.
  - nlohmann_json: its own CMake project works as a subproject, so it is used as is (see
    cmake_template's top-level `CMakeLists.txt`). `JSON_Install` follows our install option, so an
    installed package brings nlohmann with it.
  - Header-only libraries whose CMake project doesn't suit a subproject (metal) are used through
    their include directory only; their CMake project is never run.
- **System libraries** (Boost, OpenSSL, later): `find_package` only.
- **Catch2:** `nom_find_catch2()`.
- **Co-developing two repos:** set `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<NAME>` (upper-case name) to a local
  checkout, in `CMakeUserPresets.json` as above. No submodule bump is needed until you commit.
- **Moving a pin:**
  ```bash
  git -C external/nlohmann_json fetch --depth 1 origin tag v3.12.1
  git -C external/nlohmann_json checkout v3.12.1
  git add external/nlohmann_json
  ```

## App configuration collection

When an app directory contains `config/`, `nom_app()` stages its contents at
`build/<preset>/config/<app-directory>/` whenever the app builds. Multiple executables declared
in the same directory share one collection target, `<project>_copy_<app-directory>_config`.
The staged folder is refreshed on each build, so deleted source files disappear as well. With
`<PROJECT>_INSTALL=ON` and the app selected for the current preset, the executable installs to `<prefix>/bin/` and the collected files to
`<prefix>/config/<app-directory>/`. Build before installing so the collected files are current.
App directory names must be unique within a combined build because they share `build/config/`.
This step copies config files; it does not generate or load runtime configuration. See the
[app recipe](howto.md#an-app).

## Modules

The *wrapper module* pattern: the headers stay the source, and `core/<repo>/<repo>.cppm` includes
them in its global module fragment and re-exports their API with `export using`. Code can then use
either `#include <<repo>/…>` or `import nom.<repo>;`. Rules learned so far:

- Put all `#include`s before the `import`s in a file.
- A module does not make the std headers it includes visible to importers: include what you use
  (for example `<string>` to compare `std::string`s).
- Macros can't be exported; importers include the macro header.
- Keep headers that pull in third-party code GCC can't take through a module outside the module.
  nlohmann 3.12 is such a case: GCC 15 rejects it in a module interface (cmake_template's
  `docs/lab/third_party_in_modules.md`).
- Installed packages carry the module interface sources (next to the headers); every consumer
  compiles its own BMIs, which are specific to the compiler and its flags.
- `<PROJECT>_BUILD_MODULES=OFF` builds everything through headers only.

## Tests

- `tests/unit/<suite>/` or inline `<code dir>/tests/<suite>/`: Catch2 unit tests, created with
  `nom_c2test()` and labeled `unit`. The root enables testing and finds Catch2 before processing
  `core/` and `apps/`, when `nom_build_tests` is enabled. Tests through `import` have their own
  folder, built only with modules on.
- `tests/integration/`: checks involving project boundaries or installation, labeled `integration`.
  `app_presets/` verifies app build/install selection; `library_usage/` is a separate CMake project
  that compiles, links and runs against this library.
  `nom_library_usage_tests()` installs the main project into
  `build/<preset>/tests/integration/library_usage/install`, then builds and runs the test project
  against that package with `find_package` (`<project>_library_usage_package`), and from source
  through `FetchContent` (`<project>_library_usage_source`).

```bash
ctest --preset dev                   # all tests
ctest --preset dev -L unit           # unit tests only
ctest --preset dev -L integration    # integration tests, including required installation
```

## Install and use

```bash
cmake --install build/release --prefix /opt/nomisma
```

```cmake
find_package(<project> 0.1 CONFIG REQUIRED)       # with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/nomisma
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE nom::<project>)
```

## Versioning

Every repo follows Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) from its first commit, starting at
`0.1.0`: MAJOR for incompatible API changes, MINOR for compatible additions, PATCH for fixes.
While MAJOR is 0 any release may break the API, so an installed `0.y` package only satisfies
requests for the same `0.y`. The version lives only in `project()`, and each release is an
annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` on `master`.

To release `x.y.z`:

1. `CMakeLists.txt`: set `VERSION x.y.z` in `project()`.
2. `CHANGELOG.md`: rename the `[Unreleased]` section to `[x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, and start a new,
   empty `[Unreleased]` above it.
3. Commit ("Release x.y.z") and merge to `master`.
4. Tag that commit on `master` and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git switch master && git pull
   python3 tools/check_version.py vx.y.z     # the check CI runs on the tag
   git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release x.y.z"
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```

## Checks and CI

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Python environment | `python3 tools/check_python.py` |
| SPDX headers | `python3 tools/check_headers.py` |
| Formatting | `tools/check_format.sh` (`--fix` to reformat) |
| Naming | `tools/check_naming.sh` (builds `clang` with `NOM_BUILD_PRESET=complete` to cover every app) |
| Release tag | `python3 tools/check_version.py <tag>` |

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the `ci` and `clang` workflows and the first three
checks on pushes to `master`, pull requests, manual runs, and `v*` tags. The version check runs
only on `v*` tags. Build and quality checks run in the CI
image `ghcr.io/<owner>/ci`, which cmake_template builds from `docker/ci/Dockerfile`.
